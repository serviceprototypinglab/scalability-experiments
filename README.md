This 'scalability-experiments' repository contains experiments related
to the determination of quantifiable boundaries for elastic scaling of
microservices via a mathematical formula.

The experiment is currently tuned for a scenario application which can
be found in the 'scaling-containers' repository.

In the formula repository you can find one implementation of the formula 
and one script to help for create the matrix that the formula use.

In the test repository is the implementation of the test for the application scaling-containers.

In the application one you can find the application one scaled as the formula indicate.

In the OpenScienceNotebook.txt you can find a description of each on of the experiments 
that we have run and a lint to the results of each one.

In the results folder you can find all the results of the test that we have run.
