This directory contains a script to simulate or emulate the scheduling
and scaling behaviour of container management platforms. It assumes the
presence of the sources of the editor vim which will be configured and
built with different parameters and increasing parallelism.

To prepare, run the following commands:

$ mkdir -p test
$ cd test
$ apt-get source vim

This should download vim-8.0.0197 or a similar version. Create a copy
of this folder to run the job tests manually.

$ cp -r vim-8.0.0197 vim-8.0.0197.copy
$ cd vim-8.0.0197.copy
$ time ./configure # ca. 8 sec.
$ time make # ca. 59 sec. for 1st time, 30 sec. for make -j5

Run the benchmark as follows after verifying that the configuration
constants are all set up appropriately:

$ python3 autoscale.py

A Docker image is partly prepared to try the same experiment without
emulation in a real Docker-Compose or Kubernetes environment. Progress
is limited due to the unhandiness of these tools.
