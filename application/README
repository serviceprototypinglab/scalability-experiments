This folder contains example Kubernetes deployment descriptors for an
application consisting of 1 stateful and 1 stateless service.
 - stateful: database, implemented with MongoDB Docker container
 - stateless: application, implemented as another Docker container

There are 3 subfolders:
 - original: unscaled instance configuration
 - optimal: optimal configuration for the benchmark workload determined
   by the tool to determine elasticity boundaries
 - practical: deviated optimal solution to account for the limitation in
   automatic scaling of MongoDB containers

We expect that with future containerised database management systems
(e.g. Crate) this limitation will disappear.
