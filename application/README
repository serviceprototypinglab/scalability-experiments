This folder contains example Kubernetes deployment descriptors for an
application consisting of 1 stateful and 1 stateless service.
 - stateful: database, implemented with MongoDB Docker container
 - stateless: application, implemented as another Docker container

There are 3 subfolders:
 - original: unscaled instance configuration
 - optimal: optimal configuration for the benchmark workload determined
   by the tool to determine elasticity boundaries
 - practical: deviated optimal solution to account for the limitation in
   automatic scaling of MongoDB containers

We expect that with future containerised database management systems
(e.g. Crate) this limitation will disappear.

Replicas are specified as follows:
 - in OpenShift/Kubernetes via command line:
    oc scale --replicas=3 rc <deployment>
    oc autoscale dc/<deployment> --min 1 --max 10
 - in OpenShift/Kubernetes via deployment descriptor:
    spec:
      scaleRef:
        ..
      minReplicas: 1
      maxReplicas: 10
      ...
 - in Docker-Compose via compose file:
    services:
      <servicename>
        deploy:
          mode: replicated
          replicas: 3

In the experiments, only Kubernetes deployments were tested on the
Google Cloud Platform.
